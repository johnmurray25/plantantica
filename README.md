## PLANTANTICA 
Plantantica is a web app that allows you to track the watering/feeding of your plants (and eventually.... much more).

Plantantica is built with Next JS, which is a popular React framework. I prefer to use typescript when possible so the app is typescriptified. 

Plantantica uses TailwindCSS for styling. I think Tailwind is great for optimizing development time and experience.

Plantantica uses Firebase as a backend. I was going to have a Reactive Spring Boot backend with Postgres or MongoDB, but my goal is free hosting :^)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
